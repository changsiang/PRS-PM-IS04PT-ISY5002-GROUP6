## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

Healthcare is undergoing a major transformation from reactive care to a more proactive approach. For this purpose, Singapore has recently announced a major healthcare initiative focusing on preventive care: Healthier SG. Amongst the five key features, Healthier SG aims to mobilise family doctors to deliver preventive care and develop health plans for regular health screening.

However, medical care is segmented into specialised areas of expertise. Ophthalmology is one such area where primary care physicians will often seek the help of the Ophthalmologists for diagnosis and management. This increases the time and cost for patient before he or she receives treatment.

Our group project addresses the need for accessible rapid eye diagnosis. Our system identifies salient clinical features via a colour fundus photo to infer a clinical diagnosis and presents it to the physician. This will allow the primary care physician to better determine whether the patient requires a specialist consultation.
